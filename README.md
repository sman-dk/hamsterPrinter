# hamsterPrinter
Prints messages from social media (Facebook, Twitter etc.) and other sources on a POS printer

The software has been tested on Debian/Ubuntu.

This software has the following dependencies:
  * POSprinter https://github.com/sman-dk/pyPOSprinter
  * And a lot more (documentation is still missing - it will get here eventually :-)
